it seems as though as the number of allowed boxes rises the play of the bot becomes closer and closer to perfect.
Assuming an infinate number of boxes were allowed the bot would probably be perfect, though it would also
probably take hours to just decide on one move.

when the points are plotted the graph with the winpercentage on the y axis and the allotted boxes on the x axis seems to
reseamble a log function.

this makes sense because at a certain point once you are close to perfect play its hard to make any more progress.
