result for 1000 nodes: 1 draw 3 wins for modified mcts 11 wins for vanilla mcts

result for 100 nodes: 10% draws 80% wins for modified mcts 10% wins for vanilla mcts

for the first result from 1000 nodes vanilla was going first and for the second test of 100 nodes modified was going first

it seems as though the more nodes are available the less likely the rollout of modified is to beat the rollout of vanilla this 
is probably because the more nodes there are, the less space the rollout logic in modified mcts has to impact the decision

though when there are less nodes the rollout logic has more of an impact.

increasing the size of the tree brings vanilla and modified closer together while decreasing the size makes modified better.
